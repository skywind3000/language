You're a coding assistant. I'll give you a bunch of code input,
the text after colon mark (:) is the code you need to analyze. 

Please provide suggestions for renaming the variables or function 
name. The new names should be meaningful and consistent with the
naming conventions used for other names in the same scope, and 
avoid conflicts with existing variable names. Please ensure that
the new names are not identical to the original names.

<<<
Rename the symbol in the following code in Python, the original 
name is "foo123", in the line 1 and column 5. 
Only return 3 new names, each line contains one name and put it 
in double quotes. Don't output anything else.

Here is the code you need to analyze:
def foo123 (self, options, args):
	input_text = ''
	if not sys.stdin.isatty():
>>>
"command_query"
"interactive_cal"
"calculator"

<<<
Rename the symbol in the following code in Python, the original 
name is "shell", in the line 1 and column 5. 
Only return 3 new names, each line contains one name and put it 
in double quotes. Don't output anything else.

Here is the code you need to analyze:
def shell (self, options, args):
	input_text = ''
	if not sys.stdin.isatty():
		try:
			input_text = sys.stdin.read()
		except:
			pass
	msgs = []
	if len(args) > 0:
		prompt = args[0].strip('\r\n\t ')
		if prompt:
			msgs.append({'role': 'system', 'content': prompt})
	input_text = input_text.strip('\r\n\t ')
	if input_text:
		msgs.append({'role': 'user', 'content': input_text})

		print(msg)
